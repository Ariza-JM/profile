"I'm Juan Manuel, a veterinary epidemiologist interested in how environmental hazards may impact the health of domestic animals, wildlife and people, especially through alimentation"

Currently, I'm a lecturer in nutrition and animal health at the Nantes Veterinary School in France. My research objectives, in a global vision, concern the evaluation of the impact of nutrition on health, at the animal/human-food-environment interface. I mainly use epidemiological methods. More specifically, my research program aims at exploring health interactions in animal production systems through a multidisciplinary approach and from a "ONE HEALTH" perspective. I study how animal diets could improve their health and performance and reduce their environmental impact. At the same time, people could benefit from better quality food from better fed animals.

If that sounds interesting, check out my research [papers]({{ site.url }}/profile/assets/JDS17_ARIZA-JM.pdf }}).

In my free time, I learn something, read and mostly I climb.
